# Mini-Project(Music Genre Detection And Recommendation System)
HahaHarmony!!

Many a times, we like a song but are unable to find/tell it’s genre. This can be quite
important if you want to listen to similar songs and enrich your music experience
thus we felt the need to provide with genre detection for music as well as recommend
similar songs. Additionally we have implemented a chatroom feature to help users
interact with each other based on their liking and share their thoughts and personal
recommendations.
So following are the features our website offers:
• Music genre detection.
• Music recommendation platform.
• A chatroom for music enthusiasts to share their views.
