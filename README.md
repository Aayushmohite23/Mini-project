This is a simple music recommendation system made using simple text processing and python libraries based on lyrical data. The dataset contains of over 53000 songs and the model is trained using 5000 songs. Usage of spotify API is done for better representaion of results (Image/song posters). The project can be used by installing streamlit UI and running on the local computer. The project poster and report is included in the repository.
This project was a part of our main mini-project which consisted of music-genre detection and recommendation system along with a chatroom feature developed using socket.io.
